# NodeMaps
A google maps app using Nodejs and Express

You must provide a Google maps API key to test the app

The app is just a route that creates a marker and a info window whenever the user clicks a part of the map; the info window contains the object that the geocode service returns.

To add the API KEY, go to views/layout.pug and in the last script tag at the bottom paste your api key
